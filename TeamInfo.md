## Project Summary

Project Summary

This project aims to develop a web-based application that leverages a relational SQL database to manage a car dealershipâ€™s inventory. The website will allow dealerships to handle several tasks related to managing the availability of cars in their dealership. The primary features include searching, creating, updating, and deleting entries through input car information, as well as seeing which cars in their inventory are the most popular according to market trends. It will provide users with an easy-to-use interface, allowing quick access to the database. They will be able to input details such as make, model, year, transmission type, drive wheel, engine specifications, and listing price to use the functionalities listed above. This allows dealerships to manage their car inventories in real-time.
